    <p>Nothing screams "summer" quite like blueberry pie. This top-rated blueberry recipe will quickly become a seasonal staple in your home!</p>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated blueberry pie recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sugar: </b>This blueberry pie recipe starts with a cup of white sugar.</li>
            <li><b>Cornstarch: </b>Cornstarch thickens the blueberry pie filling, preventing runniness.</li>
            <li><b>Cinnamon: </b>Ground cinnamon adds subtle warmth.</li>
            <li><b>Salt: </b>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry pie filling, but it won't make it taste salty.</li>
            <li><b>Blueberries: </b>Of course, you'll need fresh blueberries! If you can't find fresh, frozen (and thawed) will work.</li>
            <li><b>Pie Crust: </b>Use a store-bought or homemade pastry crust.</li>
            <li><b>Butter: </b>You'll need just a tablespoon of butter.</li>            
        </ul>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; sprinkle over blueberries.</li>
            <li>Line a pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the crust and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide strips. Use the strips to weave a lattice top. Crimp and flute the edges.</li>
